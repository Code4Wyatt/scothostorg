            It is hoped that this information signposts the kind people who have
            volunteered to be hosts to the people of Ukraine to some community
            supports which will assist with long term planning. It is hoped that
            this might be beneficial in empowering the families who now live
            with you, and supporting them to gain their independence here in the
            UK. It is recommended that these tasks are all progressed with the
            family/individual and not for them; completing these tasks will
            empower individuals, support them with integrating into the
            community, develop an understanding of the new area they are in, and
            provide opportunities to make choices and decisions about their long
            term future plans. It is important to acknowledge that many
            families/individuals will be planning on returning to Ukraine and
            this is where they see their long term future. Remaining respectful
            of this and acknowledging it when these plans are being implemented
            will evidence shared optimism.{" "}

              <h4>Bennefit Applications</h4>
              <p>
                  Universal Credit is a government benefit payment designed to help with living costs. It's paid monthly
(or twice a month for some people in Scotland). Universal Credit replaces: Housing Benefit; incomerelated Employment and Support Allowance (ESA); income-based Jobseeker's Allowance
(JSA); Child Tax Credit; Working Tax Credit; and Income Support. There are several stages involved
in claiming Universal Credit, and usually it must be claimed online
              </p>
              <p>
                  Translation services are apparently going to be available to help new arrivals with phone applications,
and there will be Work Coaches in DWP Jobcentres on hand to support people making claims online.

              </p>
              <p>
                  DWP staff are also reportedly delivering additional face-to-face assistance to those who need it –
including tailored support to find work and advice on benefit eligibility.

              </p>
              <p>Claiming Universal Credit can involve several stages, and citizens advise can make them easier.
They can help with:
              </p>
              <ul>
                  <li><b>Quick questions</b> - answering queries as a claim is made</li>
                  <li><b>Support to submit a claim</b> - setting up email and bank accounts if needed, and working
through claim ‘to-dos</li>
                  <li><b>Support to first payment</b> - helping apply for additional financial support and prepare for work
coach appointments</li>
                  <li><b>Evidence checking</b> -  making sure all the claim evidence is correct</li>
                 
              </ul>
              <p>Universal Credit is paid once a month, usually into a bank, building society or credit union account.
Setting up a bank account asap is therefore an important first task as details will be required for the
benefit application. If the individual can not open a bank account for any reason, phone the helpline
                  to identify how they can receive the payments. Universal Credit helpline Telephone: 0800 328 5644</p>
              <p>If/when the family or individual seek independent housing, housing benefit is included within universal
credit. In Scotland applicants can apply for this contribution to be paid to them to pass on to the
landlord or it can be paid straight to the landlord. From experience, it is recommended that it be paid
straight to the landlord as unfortunately if this guarantee can not be provided many private landlords
                  will not consider tenants paying with benefit contributions. </p>
              <p>Regarding long term housing plans, please consider your local area when offering to host. Applying
for a council property is done online via your local authority website. It is important to highlight that
waitlists for council properties are generally long and it can take time for a property to be allocated;
houses are allocated on a points system. From experience anything bigger than a two bed property
can take a while. Please check to see the volume of affordable private lets in your area, you can do a
quick search on right move for example. This can be helpful for you to gain an understanding of the
families/individuals longer term options within your location. It is also worth enquiring when the
council housing application is being made if the family/individual can apply for housing anywhere or if
they need to remain local due to you being what is referred to as their “local connection”. Shelter
                  Scotland can be a good resource for advice regarding housing. </p>
              <p>Recommended actions
                  :</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>Contact/locate your local job centre and citizens advice. Find out in advance if they have
translators in certain days or if they advise to use the phone/online route if they are not
offering this service. The CAB are also very helpful in answering questions about the process
of claiming benefits. <a href="https://www.cas.org.uk/bureaux?postcode=">Bureaux | Citizens Advice Scotland (cas.org.uk)</a></li>
                  <li>Google for your local “advice shop”. These are invaluable community supports regarding the
benefits system that are already in place and function to help many. If you attend in advance
it may boost your knowledge and understanding of how to then support the family/individual
complete this process when they arrive. </li>
                  <li>Search for local affordable private lets to understand local long term housing options</li>
                  <li>These actions will enable you to be prepared for completing benefit applications asap. You
may be able to have appointments arranged for handing in ID in advance, or even arrange
the appointment with a translator to complete the application at the job centre.<ul><li>Universal credit can be applied for online/on the phone/in person. Identify with the
information you gather what option is going to be best for your family/individual and
prepare for this.</li><li>Local Authority housing applications are completed online, find your local authority
link and read through the process.</li></ul>
</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Bank Account</h4>
              <p>RBS currently have a specific webpage for people from Ukraine to open an account with them, the
webpage gives clear and easy instructions. You do need to attend a branch to complete the
                  application - <a href="https://www.rbs.co.uk/ukraine-refugees.html">
                      Ukrainian Refugee Account Opening | Royal Bank of Scotland Bank Accounts (rbs.co.uk)
</a></p>
              <p>Natwest is exactly the same - <a href="https://www.natwest.com/ukraine-refugees.html">

              </a></p>
              <p>
                  Applicants do not need a phone number for these applications. If you are however planning to
provide a phone and pay as you go sim card, please note that Vodafone, EE, O2, Three and BT have
announced that contact to Ukraine will be free on their networks. This is very important to support
families and individuals to have contact with their friends and families. 
              </p>
              <p>Recommended Actions:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>It is recommended that this is a priority as will assist with benefit applications</li>
                  <li>Check the webpage to know what documents are needed, print off the application or get one
from a branch. There are also guidance notes in Ukrainian which might be helpful to print.</li>
                  <li>The website provides quick steps to complete the application</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Community Supports</h4>
              <p>It is suggested that identifying local community supports in advance will assist the family/individual
with integrating and developing independence here in the UK. Identify your local community hub and
find out what supports and services they have there. If you know there are a lot of people moving to
the community from Ukraine perhaps discuss with the hub if they would be willing to facilitate a group
                  for Ukrainian refugees.</p>
              <p>Community hubs and family centres are excellent resources, they regularly have groups for mental
health needs such as stress, anxiety and depression. They provide mother and toddler groups for
rarely more than £1 per family. Advice shops, exercise classes and other hobby groups are often
located within them. These hubs could be valuable to people as the provisions are inexpensive and
                  will support people with meeting others locally so they can expand their support network.</p>
              <p>When visiting the GP to collect registration forms, it is recommended that you look at the notice
boards as they often have a lot of excellent community services advertised here.
              </p>
              <p>Visit your local authority website as this can be a great source of information for local services that will
                  help meet the needs of the families/individuals moving here. </p>
              <p>I would recommend contacting your local authority gym to see if they would be willing to provide free
membership for a year for the family. Similarly any local activities that provide age appropriate
                  activities for children (zoo/farm/soft play), they may provide a season ticket free of charge.</p>
              <p>Recommended Actions:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>Identify your local community hub and find out what supports and services they have there</li>
                  <li>Discuss with the hub if they would be willing to facilitate a group for Ukrainian refugees</li>
                  <li>Identify any useful community supports from GP</li>
                  <li>Contact local activities to see if they would be willing to provide any free memberships to
support the integration and social/emotional wellbeing of Ukrainian refugees</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Education And Employment</h4>
              <p>If you have any under school aged children staying with you it is suggested googling for a community
play group as many except two year old funding (can be applied for if receiving certain benefits) so
can be utilised before a child is allocated free nursery hours. Some school attached nurseries also
provide 2 year old funded placements and this is worth enquiring about if you have a 2 year old
moving in with you. Some three years olds do not get allocated nursery hours until the next school
term after their birthday, so these services can be valuable for over a year in some circumstances.
              </p>
              <p>It would also be advised to contact the health visiting team linked to your GP as they can provide
information on community groups for mothers and children under 5. Identify your local library as they
can be good sources of activities for children and run free bookbug sessions for under 5s which are a
fun activity for parents and children.
              </p>
              <p>It is advised to contact your local authorities pupil placement team, their contact details should be
easily found on google or the LA website. If you are considering having children placed with you,
enquire what ages the local school has spaces for. If they do not have spaces ask where the closest
school is that could accommodate that age. It is important to know if it is feasible for the parent to get
the child to and from school independently before committing to all ages of children. Enquire at the
same time how to submit an application, this is ordinarily done via a form on the local authorities
website under education services (the same process for all ages) however they may have a different
process for these circumstances.
              </p>
              <p>Once a school is identified please find out what the uniform requirements are, apparently school
uniform is uncommon in Ukraine. Local authorities may offer support to purchase this, please check
this website which explains who can apply and the entitlement: <a href="https://www.mygov.scot/clothing-grants">Help with school clothing costs -
mygov.scot.</a>. You need to apply for his through the local authority, the links are also on this webpage.
An application can also be made for free school meals at the same time. Supporting the child to
purchase school uniform could be a helpful way to encourage their sense of inclusion within the new
school community.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Schools offer a lot of emotional and social supports by law, educational psychologists are also
allocated to every school to offer advice and support as required. Primary schools and secondary
schools however can be daunting and if the child had any additional needs previously it is important that this information is shared. It is recommended that if a meeting is arranged with the school that a
translator is requested if required to ensure the needs of the child are met. Local
authorities/education are experienced with having translators at meetings so this request is not
uncommon. 
              </p>
              <p>Contact your local college to confirm if they have any courses that are starting for the summer term if
you have young people of this age group. Enquire to see if they have any adult English language
courses and ask if they would offer a free place. Local authorities also run excellent apprentice
                  programmes which might be useful to have information on for 16+ young people.</p>
              <p>The global language school if offering free online English lessons to all Ukrainian refugees to assist
with their integration and inclusion. You can contact the service via facebook of email
                  paulo@globalschool.uk to access the lessons. </p>
              <p><a href="https://www.wea.org.uk/skills/ESOL">ESOL courses - learn English for FREE | WEA </a> - There are free ESOL classes online which people
can enrol on to support their English language development. Lots of colleges also run courses - <a href="https://www.esolcourses.com/esol-courses/scotland.html">ESOL
                      Courses in Scotland</a> - and local authorities may provide this as well if you search their website. </p>
              <p>The skills network offers free online courses in a variety of subjects if anyone wants to access
education whilst they are waiting for school/college to start. Their website provides details: <a href="https://theskillsnetwork.com/courses/find-a-course?funded_location_scotland=scotland">: Find a
Course | The Skills Network
                  </a></p>
              <p>With regards to seeking employment, your local job centre will be a source of support and information
for people. In addition to this most local authority websites have an employment advice section which
includes an access2employment team (or something similar). These are a team of professional
employment advisors who can offer 1:1 support to identify employment and education opportunities.
They often have weekly bulletins which list local opportunities.
              </p>
              <p>Recommended Actions: </p>
              <ul>
                  <li>Contact pupil placement to confirm what age availability and where. </li>
                  <li>Confirm with pupil placement how to submit an application, some local authorities are
accepting applications in advance if you have the children’s details. 
</li>
                  <li>Identify community playgroups or aged two nursery provisions in local area if housing a child
who will not yet receive free nursery hours – local health visitor team at the GP will be a good
source for this info.</li>
                  <li>Contact colleges if required for 16+ and local authority apprentices</li>
                  <li>Request a translator for any education meetings if needed</li>
                  <li>Identify local library</li>
                  <li>Identify local authority employment support service, they may also provide help with CV
writing if needed</li>
                  <li>Confirm school uniform requirements and apply for school uniform grant and free school
meals if applicable</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Health</h4>
              <p>Registering at a GP will be required, it is suggested that you gather the registration forms in advance
and confirm what documents they will need to see when they are returned (this is normally a birth
certificate but they might accept the visa/passport). Some also require all adults to hand in their own
                  form so check their policy regarding this.</p>
              <p>Register under 5s to ensure they are allocated a health visitor, this will also support them with being
offered childhood immunisations.
              </p>
              <p>If you feel you have built a relationship already that enables you to enquire about any needed
medication this might be beneficial. Pharmacies do not have everything in stock and the individual may be low on medication at this point. You will then be able to speak with your local pharmacist to
confirm if they do stock it or the length of time it will take them to receive after a prescription has been
provided. This will then dictate the urgency to see a GP.
              </p>
              <p>It is important to acknowledge the severity of this situation and the level of trauma that has been
experienced by the Ukrainian people. Providing long term trauma informed support will be imperative.
The information provided to the group regarding Barnardo’s offering support is excellent. In addition
to the info already provided Barnardo’s have set up the Ukrainian Support Helpline to provide a
holistic support service. The Helpline is available to anyone fleeing the conflict in Ukraine. All
                  services include access to interpreters in Ukrainian and Russian.</p>
              <p>People can get in touch if they need support with:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>Therapy with a qualified psychotherapist – delivered via the phone or online, with access to
interpreters</li>
                  <li>Advice on a range of issues e.g., housing, accessing key health services, education,
employment and more via our trained helpline support workers</li>
                  <li>Practical support - access to digital devices to ensure families stay connected to loved ones
during this worrying time, as well as stimulating toys for children, vital baby items and more</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The GP will also be a source of support and will be able to signpost/refer to local community mental
health services. This includes supports for children with CAMHS. Education professionals will also
be able to support and refer children and young people for inputs as identified. As mentioned above,
please discuss with your local community hubs/family centres and look for advertised supports within
your GP practice. If any adults have known additional needs and have previously accessed support,
it is advised that your local authority social care contact centre is spoken with and they will be able to
                  advise how the adult can access services/entitlements.</p>
              <p>Recommended Actions: </p>
              <ul>
                  <li>Collect registration forms from GP and confirm how to complete process</li>
                  <li>Enquire about medication if appropriate</li>
                  <li>Familiarise self with community local supports</li>
                  <li>Provide information to families/individuals when they arrive in welcome pack
</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Inclusion</h4>
              <p>Supporting the family/individual to feel empowered and included within the local community is an
important step after the initial stage. Gaining a bus pass could be helpful to support independence,
again I would recommend enquiring to see if your local bus provider will give this free of charge.
Gaining a youngscot card for any 11-26 year olds provides a lot of benefits including free bus travel <a href="https://young.scot/the-young-scot-card/">Young Scot National Entitlement Card | Young Scot</a>. Within your welcome pack including bus times
                  and routes to key destinations might be valuable.</p>
              <p>It has been highlighted a few times that a welcome pack is helpful as please remember when the
family/individual arrives their capacity to retain verbal information might be limited due to the
overwhelming experience. It is suggested other simple things that can help are keeping doors within
your home open to start with until everyone feels confident what room is what; this avoids any anxiety
about having to open each door to find the bathroom. Having signs on doors for the bathroom can be
helpful, if you have integrated appliances, a label for the fridge etc. People might feel anxious or
uncomfortable to ask for food or just to take it initially if this is the arrangement; having food out on
display can eliminate these anxieties in the early stages so people are not uncomfortable have to
                  rummage through cupboards trying to find things. </p>
              <p>If you have children moving into your home it is recommended that you have waterproof sheets on the
beds; it is not uncommon for children who have experienced trauma to wet the bed at all ages.
Having a laundry basket available and spare bedding/towels accessible can be supportive. Having
different types of cups and cutlery for younger children might also be beneficial. Placing nightlights in
                  your hall ways can be useful in case the child or adult needs to get up in the dark.</p>
              <p>Ensure that you have the correct car seats for the child’s safety. Information on what is required since
the law change in 2017 can be found here. <a href="https://www.mygov.scot/child-safety">Keeping your child safe - mygov.scot.</a></p>
              <p>If you are having children to stay with you and you do not have parental controls on your internet/TV,
please discuss this with the child’s parent to ensure the child’s safety and protection. </p>
              <p>Please google for your local family centre, community hub, children’s charity and social enterprises.
These can be excellent resources for pre loved toys and children essentials. Many have been
accepting donations for Ukraine since the war began and may have a large stock of useful items.
Google for your local clothing bank as if the collections have not got what your family/individual need
you may be able to get it from here. Community shops are also excellent resources and not only
provide very reasonably priced food but one of their aims is to decrease food wastage. These are
often found at community hubs, family centres and play cafes. Charity shops also regularly have toys
and books a plenty! Your local bike library might also have a bike for a child/young person.</p>
              <p>Other nationals support agencies who may provide answers to any questions you have or
advice/guidance are the Scottish Refugee Council and British Red Cross. </p>
              <p>Please remember if you are getting a second hand cot/moses basket to refer to the NHS guidance on
safer sleep and purchase new mattresses/don’t use bumpers <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/baby/caring-for-a-newborn/reduce-the-risk-of-sudden-infant-death-syndrome/">Reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)</a></p>
