            You have already jumped through hoops of red tape and bureaucracy
            and the day of arrival day for your guests is looming. It may seem
            that the hard work is already done however it is only starting as we
            need to be ready for Day 1 in our guests new temporary lifestyle in
            our home for the next 6 months and possibly up to 3 years We have to
            remember that we are hosting to people of whom we will have little
            concept of their recent, current and future experiences and will
            have to keep an open mind to what we might have to offer them.
            Although it is our home and usually our rules some of our guests may
            have different cultural and spiritual beliefs and communication
            skills. They may also be very proud and not always ask for items or
            assistance (or unable to due to language barrier) We may have to
            anticipate some of their practical/ daily living needs. Here are
            some recommendations to assist with our hosting experiences. Your
            own local authority may also provide guidance.

            suggestions.
